Retrobat Theme:	Comic Pop (version 1.0)
Creator:		Dwayne Hurst
Date:			August 2022
Contact me:		hurstyd@gmail.com

Background: After years of making themes for EmulationStation, this is
			my first attempt at making a Theme for RetroBat. It is likely I
			have made mistakes, but I am happy to revise and tweak upon request.
			
Concept:	The theme is inspired by Comic Book Covers and Pop Vinyls.
			All the custom media is made by me.

Details:	Over 600 systems and collection folders.
			Over 20 'auto-colletions' that work via metadata.
			
Options:
	Game Views:			5x (Carousel, Grid, Basic, Detailed, Video)
	Wheel Art Options:	6x (Comic Word, Comic Boxed, Rainbow, Logo Boxed, Simple, Clear logo)
	Main Carousel:		5x (Left Curved, Right Curved, Left Straight,
						Right Straight, Bottom Horizontal)
	Character Art:		6x (Comic Cover, Flyer, Pop Box, Pop Combo,
						Character, System)
	Animations:			All animations can be turned on of off as a group selection
	Videos:				Either random vidoe from scraped videos, or you can add your 
						own system snaps in '_inc/videos'. Video names need to match theme
						folders like 'snes', 'nes', 'genesis' etc.
						
Missing Systems:		I have done my best to make these as complete as possible.
						However I am new to Retrobat and may have missed some things.
						Contact me via email or messenger and I will consider adding more to the theme.
						
Final massage:			Please me respectful to all theme creators. Despite comments of a few in the
						gaming community, I am very approachable and enjoy tweaking and making
						changes to suit peoples requirements.
